# WorkflowDomainModels

This package is designed to hold the different models that encompass running a workflow inside of CodeCatalyst. This includes
but may not be limited to the workflow model, workflow triggers, the workflow action structure, the build action, the test 
action, the compute action, and the Github action runner action. Overtime these sets of models will grow into a full SDK
that allows users to generate workflow YAML's by just interaction with this package.
